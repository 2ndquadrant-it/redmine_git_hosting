#### Can I install Gitolite and Redmine on different servers ?

**No, you can't**. Redmine and Gitolite **must be on the same server** as Redmine needs to access to repository files (via sudo) to display them within the interface.

Now you know about that, think about the latency you could have when you browse your repository ;)
