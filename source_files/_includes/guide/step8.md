The plugin is now installed, but you **must** set some additional settings on the *Administration -> Redmine Git Hosting* page.

Before configuring the plugin you should take a look at this : [Repositories Storage Configuration Strategy](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/wiki/Configuration-notes#repositories-storage-configuration-strategy).

You will able to check your installation in *Config Checks* tabs.
