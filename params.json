Git repositories are automatically created when the repository is created in Redmine.\r\nThere is also an option to automatically create a Git repository for a project, when the project is created.\r\nCaching functionality is also implemented to speed page-load times for viewing Git repositories.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nEverything is in the wiki : https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/wiki\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright & License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nicolas Rodriguez (nrodriguez@jbox-web.com) MIT License.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 John Kubiatowicz (kubitron@cs.berkeley.edu) MIT License.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2010-2011 Eric Bishop (ericpaulbishop@gmail.com) MIT License.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2009-2010 Jan Schulz-Hofen, ROCKET RENTALS GmbH (http://www.rocket-rentals.de).
