As you can see, the Github page has been reworked to be more clear :)

**For the braves :**

I need testers for testing this version and specially the migration from 0.7.x. If you're interested ```git clone``` the devel branch and test it ! :)

I wrote a [development guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/development/) if you're interested on working/testing the plugin.
