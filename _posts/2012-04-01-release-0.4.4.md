This release includes feature enhancements and bug fixes.

Compatibility with Redmine 1.1-Stable. A couple of patches were included to permit this plugin to work with older Redmine releases.

* New settings to configure the /tmp and /bin directories (**gitTemporaryDir** and **gitScriptDir** respectively).
* New settings for the default "Daemon Mode" (**gitDaemonDefault**), "SmartHTTP mode" (**gitHttpDefault**), and "Notify CIA mode" (**gitNotifyCIADefault**) for new repositories.
* Better script support for installing scripts in the /bin directory.
* Updated installation instructions in the README.
* Better recovery from loss of administrative key in gitolite -- assuming use of gitolite version >= 2.0.3.
* Fix : Improvements to repository mirror support.
* Fix : Support '@' in user names for http access (externally converted to '%40').
* Fix : Syntax fixes to allow use of Ruby 1.9.
* Fix : Support for git-daemon now working correctly.  The "daemon" key was not being removed correctly and projectgs with "daemon" support were not being deleted.
* Fix : Better handling of null-buffer condition in smart-http.
* Fix : Fixed language tags in localization files.
