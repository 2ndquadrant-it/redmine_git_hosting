#### Release 0.4.5x

**Date :** April 23, 2012

**Download :** [here](https://github.com/kubitron/redmine_git_hosting/tree/0.4.5x)

**Changelog :**

This is a bug-fix release.

* Fixed missed case for compatibility with Redmine 1.1-Stable.  This patch allows the mirror functionality to work.
* Fixed bad interaction between cron cleanup of /tmp and access to gitolite-admin repository in /tmp.  Behavior could cause user keys to appear to be deleted, even though they remain in the redmine database.  This behavior has likely been a part of this plugin since before this branch was forked (pre 0.4.2).
