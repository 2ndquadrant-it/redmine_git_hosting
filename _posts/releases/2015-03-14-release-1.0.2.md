**Notes :**

* Depending on your Redmine version (2.x/3.x) you'll have to comment/uncomment the right lines in the plugin's ```Gemfile```

* Before update Redmine Git Hosting plugin you **must** update Redmine Bootstrap Kit plugin to version **0.2.2** :

      # Update Redmine Bootstrap Kit
      redmine$ cd REDMINE_ROOT/plugins/redmine_bootstrap_kit
      redmine$ git fetch -p
      redmine$ git checkout 0.2.2

      # Cleanup plugins assets dir
      redmine$ cd REDMINE_ROOT/public/plugin_assets
      redmine$ rm -rf *

* Since [support of Ruby 1.9.x has ended](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/01/10/ruby-1-9-3-will-end-on-2015/), **we won't support Ruby 1.9.x anymore**.
We highly recommend that you upgrade to Ruby 2.1 or 2.0.0 as soon as possible.
