**Notes :**

* Before update Redmine Git Hosting plugin you **must** update Redmine Bootstrap Kit plugin to version **0.2.3** :

      # Update Redmine Bootstrap Kit
      redmine$ cd REDMINE_ROOT/plugins/redmine_bootstrap_kit
      redmine$ git fetch -p
      redmine$ git checkout 0.2.3

      # Cleanup plugins assets dir
      redmine$ cd REDMINE_ROOT/public/plugin_assets
      redmine$ rm -rf *

* Deployment keys permissions has been renamed (from ```*_deployment_keys``` to ```*_repository_deployment_credentials```) so you will have to reset them in *Administration -> Roles*.
