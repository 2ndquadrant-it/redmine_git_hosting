As explained in [Gitolite documentation](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/non-core.html#localcode) hooks should be installed in a separate directory.
This new version fixes Gitolite hooks install path for Gitolite v3.

Hooks are now stored by default in ```<gitolite user home dir>/local```. You can override this in the plugin settings.

Note that the directory must be **a relative path** to the Gitolite user home directory.

You'll also have to update your ```.gitolite.rc``` accordingly :

    LOCAL_CODE  =>  "$ENV{HOME}/local"
