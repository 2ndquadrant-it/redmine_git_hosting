This release includes feature enhancements and bug fixes.

* One of the most important aspects of this release is a fix for the performance problems that plagued earlier versions of the plugin for post 1.2 Redmine. Fetch_changesets operations should now be possible.
* A second aspect is support for selinux.  Scripts have been placed into a separate /bin directory which is placed at the root of the plugin (i.e. REDMINE_ROOT/vendor/plugins/redmine_git_hosting/bin).  A set of rake tasks have been added to assist in installing selinux tags and pre-building scripts in the bin directory.
