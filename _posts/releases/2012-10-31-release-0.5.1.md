This is a bug-fix release.

* Post-Receive URLs should now work with SSL (i.e. URLs of the form "https://xxx")
* Additional patches for backward compatibility with ChiliProject/Redmine < 1.4. In this category was a problem with editing Git repo parameters as well as a minor bug that caused problems with adding members to projects that didn't have a Git repo.
* Additional patches to support Ruby 1.9.x.  Includes fix to post-receive hook and change in meaning of Module#instance_methods.
* Patched installation so that can install Redmine from *scratch* (i.e. run `rake db:migrate` on empty DB) with plugin already in place.
* Latest migration should now work with PostGreSQL.  This was broken in 0.5.0x.
