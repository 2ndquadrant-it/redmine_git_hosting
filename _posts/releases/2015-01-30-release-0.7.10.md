<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Important !</b>
  <br>
  <br>This is the last version of the v0.7 branch. <b>There won't be new releases under this branch.</b>
  <br>That means that everyone should migrate to the new 1.0 version :)
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Important !</b>
  <br>
  <br>Before migrating to the new 1.0 you <b>MUST</b> migrate to this version (0.7.10).
  <br>It includes a Rake task that prepare the migration to 1.0, so <b>don't miss that step!</b>
</div>
