{{ site.data.callouts.alertwarning }}
  **Important !**

  This is the last version of the v0.7 branch. **There won't be new releases under this branch**.

  That means that everyone should migrate to the new 1.0 version :)

{{ site.data.callouts.alertwarning }}
  **Important !**

  Before migrating to the new 1.0 you **MUST** migrate to this version (0.7.10).

  It includes a Rake task that prepare the migration to 1.0, so **don't miss that step!**
