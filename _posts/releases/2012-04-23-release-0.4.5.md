* Fixed missed case for compatibility with Redmine 1.1-Stable.  This patch allows the mirror functionality to work.
* Fixed bad interaction between cron cleanup of /tmp and access to gitolite-admin repository in /tmp.  Behavior could cause user keys to appear to be deleted, even though they remain in the redmine database.  This behavior has likely been a part of this plugin since before this branch was forked (pre 0.4.2).
